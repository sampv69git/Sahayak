    <string name="story_text_placeholder">Select a story to read.</string>
    <string name="story_ram_text">The Ramayan begins in the peaceful kingdom of Ayodhya, where Prince Rama is born to King Dasharatha. Rama is loved for his humility, courage, and flawless character. When he wins Sita’s hand by lifting and breaking Lord Shiva’s bow, their marriage becomes a symbol of love and purity. But destiny tests Rama when his stepmother Kaikeyi demands that he be exiled for 14 years so her son Bharata becomes king. Rama accepts the decision calmly, believing that a promise must always be honored. Sita and Lakshmana choose to go with him, showing devotion stronger than comfort or fear. In the forest they meet sages, demons, and holy beings. One day, the demoness Shurpanakha tries to harm Sita, leading to a series of events where her brother, Ravana, the mighty king of Lanka, kidnaps Sita using deception. Rama and Lakshmana search endlessly, refusing to give up hope. They soon meet Hanuman, whose devotion to Rama becomes legendary. Hanuman leaps across the ocean, finds Sita in Ashoka Vatika, and gives her strength when she feels imprisoned and alone. With the help of the vanara king Sugriva, a massive bridge is built to Lanka. The war between Rama and Ravana is intense and filled with supernatural power. After days of fierce battle, Rama defeats Ravana and rescues Sita. They return to Ayodhya, where Rama is crowned king, symbolizing that patience, truth, and righteousness always win, even when the journey is long and difficult. The Ramayan teaches that duty and virtue can guide a person through every hardship and that love, loyalty, and courage create paths even through darkness.</string>
    <string name="story_mahabharath_text">The Mahabharat is the vast story of two branches of the same royal family — the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The Pandavas, sons of Pandu, are known for their strength and integrity: Yudhishthira the just, Bhima the powerful, Arjuna the master archer, and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva known for grace and wisdom. The Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, grow with jealousy and ambition burning in their hearts. Tension rises when the Pandavas build a magnificent kingdom at Indraprastha, making Duryodhana insecure and angry. He invites Yudhishthira to a deceitful dice game, where with trickery, the Pandavas lose everything — their kingdom, their wealth, and even their freedom. They are forced into exile for 13 long years, during which they face trials, build alliances, and strengthen their resolve. When the exile ends, the Pandavas ask only for a small portion of their kingdom. Duryodhana arrogantly refuses, saying he will not give even land “the size of a needle’s tip.” War becomes inevitable. As the armies gather at Kurukshetra, Arjuna loses his courage seeing his own family, teachers, and friends standing on both sides. At this moment, Krishna reveals the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, reminding Arjuna that one must stand for justice without being controlled by fear or attachment. The battlefield becomes a place of heroism and tragedy. Great warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Abhimanyu, and Ghatotkacha fall. Every day of the war brings loss, sacrifice, and harsh realizations about ego, pride, and destiny. In the end, the Pandavas win, but it is a victory mixed with pain. The Mahabharat teaches that unchecked greed destroys even the strongest, while truth and righteousness, though slower, always rise again. It shows that dharma is not easy to follow, but it is the only path that leads to peace.</string>
